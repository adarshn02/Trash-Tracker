In TrashTracker, you control a cleaning truck equipped with a net to capture trash cans that throw garbage at your vehicle. The cleaning truck has a health meter that depletes when hit by trash. Trash cans come in three colors: red, blue, and green, each with unique behavior. You must move your truck using the W, A, S, and D keys and dispense the net using the spacebar. The game features an engaging intro screen with instructions and background music playing throughout. As you progress through levels, you'll face waves of trash can enemies, and the challenge intensifies.
